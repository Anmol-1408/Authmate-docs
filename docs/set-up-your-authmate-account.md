# Set up your AuthMate account

Before integrating AuthMate into your application, you need to create an AuthMate account and set up a new project in the AuthMate Dashboard. This guide will walk you through these steps.

## Sign in to AuthMate

Create an AuthMate account or sign in to the [AuthMate Dashboard](https://authmate.xyz/auth/login).

## Create an AuthMate project

After signing in, you will be redirected to the AuthMate Dashboard. To create a new project, select the **Create project** button. This will take you to the interactive authentication project setup form.

In the setup form, you will be guided to build your authentication flow according to your requirements.

## Integrate AuthMate into your application

Once your project is created in the AuthMate Dashboard, you will receive an API key for that specific project. Use this API key to integrate AuthMate into your codebase.

To get started quickly, use one of our available quickstart guides on [authmate.xyz](https://authmate.xyz).
